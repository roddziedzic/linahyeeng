I'm starting a new job and the computer they ask for is very specific, but i dont know much about computers and I'm lost This is what i was told exactly: HP Z1 Workstation (all in one form factor workstation. Has 802. 11 a/b/g/n 2.4 GHz and 5GHz WiFi. Display - port in/out port. Expandable all in one chassis. SSDs. Articulated hinge. VESA mountable. Blu-ray burner).  I have an Asus Zenbook Flip and an RCA Smart TV (don't know which model). In order to open the TV up for pairing, I press Hi-Smart on the remote, and then select "Wi-Fi Display" from the menu. Easy. Then I swipe left on the laptop screen and click Connect. It recognizes my TV as HIS-TV-SINK-FF88, and I click it. Buuuut it only works maybe 20% of the time. But it does work, so it's not a compatibility issue. The other 80% I get an error in yellow type saying "Couldn't connect." I've checked. Ваши комментарии отправлены. Благодарим за информацию.

I've been using the same Chromecast since 2017. never had any problem. not until last monday. We updated our wifi so the modem had to be replaced with something new. Now, Chromecast can't connect to the new Wifi. I've tried everything I can to fix it. I rebooted it, I removed it on our Home, I set it up again. One time, it connected to the new wifi but it disconnected itself after 30 seconds. Every solution I read online said that the first step is I had to make sure that my phone and Chromec. # Changes Added A12 support # Description BoostedWifi removes the default signal level limit to show all networks in range and displays the current signal level (RSSI) for each network. # Repo Available on the BigBoss repo for free ( # Contact You can contact me on twitter: @KingPuffdaddi or via email: kingpuffdaddi@icloud.com (mailto:kingpuffdaddi@icloud.co. Ive been burned by the LG g5s GPS, & ghosting image issues, the Nexus 5x's CPU core bootloop issue (which i eventually got out of boot loop), and the Pixel mic issue (current phone). Does the LGv30 have any documented issues? If not it seems like the best bootloader unlockable phone available. I just did a fresh install of Windows 10 on my T440. It seemed to automatically install every correct driver. WiFi, display, Bluetooth, webcam, etc. The only thing I notice is that some of the function keys do nothing. F1-F3 are audio control and they work F4 looks like disable microphone but it doesn't do anything F5-F6 are brightness controls and they work F7-F12 don't work. They range from switch displays to open settings Do I need software or drivers to get these working? Is there. Welcome to the Daily Tech Support Thread for r/Samsung.

I heard that it's possible but have no idea what the cheapest Surface I can buy to make it happen. Has anybody done this? Help appreciated. Mine is surprisingly the Sony Z3 Tablet Compact (611). I've been using it since 2015 and it's still doing well nowadays in terms of performance. I think that's due to the 3 GB RAM and the SD 801 that are masterpiece hardwares. But also build-wise, other than the charging port flap, which should prevent water going in (the tablet is waterproof), being a bit loose, every other hardware parts are still working flawlessly. Bluetooth, WiFi, the - already shitty - camera, loudspeaker(s?), screen. 
Hi, I'm a new arch user and I would like to disable my WiFi toggle key on my Lenovo ThinkPad. I'm not sure how to go about this. I checked some google results, none of which were any aid to me. I've read some things about udev rules, but I've got no clue how I would set up a fitting rule. xev prints the following when I press the WiFi key: KeyRelease event, serial 35, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001, root 0x16a, subw 0x0, time 19069009, (113,582), root:(1397,602), state. Hi! I have bought a MacBook Pro 2017(base specs everything) at the start of this year, and because I did not want to spend a fortune on Apple dongles, I bought this (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07HHQBFSZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) one. After a while, I noticed having issues when trying to use my HDMI display with the adapter, to which the solution was simply plugging the power in the adapter. After a while, that solution seems to have failed I'm a Canadian teen that has been living with my mother for the past year or so. We recently ran away from our abusive father and I was glad that was over. However, around two months ago my mother started to display signs of mental illness, specifically paranoia thoughts about our landlord. (We live in a duplex and they live upstairs) She believes that the landlord upstairs is an expert hacker who has infiltrated all our devices, makes our computers slower, causes annoyances, sneaks Long story short, my dad is a software engineer and we have never had issues with our network and being able to connect to it. The only thing unique about this situation is that my device (iPhone 8) is the only iOS device on the network and can not connect to our home network anymore. I have no trouble connecting to other secure servers like at my job, friends networks, and etc. but at home, I do. The WiFi displays as functioning, but when my phone tries to connect it says in yellow “no intern. What is everyone's opinion about an onboard display vs not having one? Originally I thought it was better to not have one for a smaller footprint, but I can see the use for one if/when you get hit and have to provide evidence on the spot. What is the consensus. 
Why can’t Apple make a complication for the 4 Green Dots instead of it just being on the “Explorer” Watch Face. Or include more Watch Faces with the 4 Green Dots People like to change their Watch Faces often and not stick </p>
