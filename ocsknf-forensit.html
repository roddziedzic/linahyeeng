                            <p>As mentioned, I am looking for an optimal way to either manually or UI migrated a domain profile (windows 10) to a local user for someone parting the company but with their laptop. I'm mixed environments so not a master-level AD SysAdmin but I get by. The thing is up until a few years ago I'd done this all manually, but sometime around 2015 (per search results) ForensiT seems to be popping up everywhere as the quick and free solution to migrate a profile. Does anyone know if they've. My company is merging with another and we are ramping up to migrate our domain with theirs. User profiles of the desktops and laptops came up. I would like to make the transition as seamless as possible for the users and migrate their profiles when the machines are moved to the new domain. I found User Profile Wizard from ForensIT and have tested it successfully. Though some people are wary since it only changes the registry to point the new profile to the old user's profile directory. I have a Windows account conundrum I've been bouncing around in my head for a long time now and thought I'd try putting it out in public to see if anybody has knowledge or experience that might enlighten me. I've long since upgraded every other machine I have to Win10, but my 'flagship' desktop had to stay on Win7 because reasons (namely the need to support a Media Center DVR). I cut the cable cord some time back, so I'm out of reasons to stay with 7 and have been considering making Hello everyone. I have a client who is roughly 350 users/machines. They operate in a distributed workforce setup some in offices, somme from co\-working spaces, some from home. There is no servers at all in their company. They were "born in the cloud" as the buzzwords go. They rapidly expanded to their current size when I inherited them. TO centralize mgmt I am going to leverage Azure AD and InTune. I have pretty much my entire migration proof of concept mapped out except for profile migrations. 
I compiled a list of my favourite software which I think might be helpful around here: https://mythofechelon.co.uk/blog/2017/02/25/great-software. Hi all - I have an environment that I'll be moving from domain.local to ad.domain.com. The new domain is all set, however I am going to have to move profiles, or at least re-point to the original. I see a lot of reference to moving local to domain profiles, but not domain to domain. My desktop admin days are long gone, so forgive the newbness of this question. I only have about 9 users to do this for and it'll be on a few Windows 10 desktops and a couple Windows 2016 VMs. Thanks. Does anyone here use the ForensIT User Profile Wizard technician edition? I have lost my copy of it (last time I used it was about a year ago) and can't find it. I have tried contacting support all day, but no such luck. Anyone have access to their tech support, or if not, do you have a copy I can borrow until I can get in contact with them? I have the license, just no software Old AD corrupted, even MS team couldn't fix. Due to some failing drives over time. We had backups, but even in the backups the AD was corrupt. Going to upgrade their server, with a brand new one! Going to start fresh with AD. But, how do I put the old computers on a new DC with the same name and everything without them making user folders to user001, whereas the original As I noted in the title, I'm curious if anyone is familiar with a workflow or potentially software that can be used to migrate an AD user profile into a local account. I've used ForensiT in the past for Windows machines but have struggled to find something comparable So recently we've been using forensIT (https://www.forensit.com/) to move profiles on workstations from an old domain to a new domain. I've actually been very impressed with ForensIT - the product appears to work very well for what it does, and is a huge time saver (I'm not affiliated with them in any way). Here's the problem - the username for the user account is the same for both domains, both the old one, and the new one - it has to stay this way. When we move away from the old domain We have a large project coming up where everyone will be getting new laptops. During this time they will also be moved over to a new AD domain. Users have files on their local laptops. OneDrive isn't an option (sadly). Users have their current AD accounts in Domain A and have new accounts in Domain B that already are being used for things like 365. What would be the best and most efficient way to migrate all user data from laptop (Windows 7) on Domain A to their new laptop (Windows Hi all, Business i work for are merging with another company. In theory, we want to add the remote office to our forest as it is the simplest way without going down the road of nuking the domain and joining ours. My question is, is this the best way to go about this? Ideally we just want to keep them using the current domain so we dont have to restructure permissions amp profiles etc but also have their dc operate as a secondary for both domain A amp B. There is already I want to set up a new User account but retain all of the tweaking I have already done for the main account automatically. From simple things like automatically remembering the theme to more complex things like recreating the start menu settings (cortana and the like). Other things are happening, too, which I don't understand. The Taskbar keeps moving to the other monitor when I switch users and some programs (like the SteelSeries mouse software) keeps opening up when I return to the primary. 
I just installed Windows 10 on a brand new SSD. Is there any way for my user profile, such as desktop, taskbar, and other settings, to move over to the new drive? I already signed into my Microsoft account. I really did not know where to start and I could not find anything on google about transferring the data from Windows 10 to another version of Windows 10. I am running a laptop, Dell Inspiron 17R SE. Thanks in advance for all the help! You are all the greatest. Greetings, all. I have a question I'm pondering, and was hoping if someone might be able to weigh in. I've tried searching both in my own memory, as well as plunging into the vast depths of the internet, and neither has succeeded in giving clarity. The conundrum I'm pondering is: I'm working on a Windows 10 laptop - enterprise edition, build 1703. I've previously used this laptop to also access my work account (AzureAD joined). Due to a merger at the workplace, I've been terminated (amiably I've done this before using ForensiT ( but I've gotten some errors with some different programs. I'm looking to do this seamlessly as if nothing ever changed on the users machine. So from a Windows 7 local user account to users account that's on the domain, still keeping the preferences in tact with minimal errors. Thanks in advance. edit: Would also like to add that the user already exists on the domain. Edit2: RESOLVED! ForensiT actually worth. I have Windows 7 Ultimate, and I recently activated the hidden, default Administrator account. I want to know how, or if it is possible, to clone my normal account to this Administrator account. I know that I can make my account an Admin account, and I know that I can access all the files from all the users from this default Administrator account. I don't want to have to copy and paste each directory. Thanks. We are from a large institution and are attempting to migrate user profiles from domain A to domain B. We are using USMT and loadstate /md:olddomain.com:newdomain. When we run loadstate on the new machine, the new domain user is created but is appended by ".000" and creates essentially two profiles. We want a script that can consolidate migrated profiles. Any help would be appreciated. Thank. 
Hello all, Wondering if anyone has any input on this. I am migrating using the corp version of Profile Wizard. Migrating from a workgroup to a domain and using a name lookup file to match the local account to the new domain account. I am getting the following error Getting FQDN for user "Joanne". Fails. User not found in domain. Migration Fails. Joanne is not a domain account, so it makes sense that it cant find it in the domain, but why is it even trying? I used a CSV with oldname,newname. Hello I'm trying to convince the people in my company to start using AD. I have the AD already properly configured, been testing it myself for the past 2 months and everything is OK. The only problem is: how to properly migrate 70 user local profiles/workstations from local user to domain user ? As of now, their local username is totally random, and they will be migrating to a domain user such as: name.surname. Someone has to sit down on 70 workstations and join every single Hi All, Do you know a free tool that can migrate: domain profile to local (vice versa) domain a to domain. Hi Guys, Place I work at has some unjoined PC's - whats the best way to migrate these accounts into an AD domain? Keeping settings etc. Thanks. One Dell server with SBS 2003. All it does is authenticate logins from three clients and host some shared docs (not thru redirection). No Exchange server, SQL, nothing else. Client 1 is Win 8.1, client 2 is Win 7, and client 3 is Vista. All programs on the clients are installed locally. They would like to get rid of server (various reasons) and use small NAS. What's the best/easiest way to convert domain profiles to local so all progs, settings, etc remain as-is? Thanks, and please advise. I have a school who is breaking off of the domain they are on and moving to their own forest. With the new domain I am looking at moving all of the clients to the new domain. Could anyone tell me if it is possible to automate moving them to the new domain? Thanks 
It was a good little set it and forget it tool, especially for the kinds of users that freak out over little changes when moving to a new machine. Roaming profiles aren't really an option, I guess copying a user folder over might be, but will that cause problems when moving from Win7 to 10? I haven't tried it, I'm asking before I do and something goes horribly. </p>
