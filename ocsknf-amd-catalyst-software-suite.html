                            <p> Basically, what I am looking for is the AMD equivalent of the Nvida Control panel and the old AMD catalyst software suite that lets you tweak settings for games through the AMD software. Hello people of Reddit, This is regarding to an update that popped up on my computer today. By the title you guys can probably tell that it is a AMD update. But what I was wondering is that if I update this would it effect my steam or csgo in anyway shape or form? Here is a picture of what the popup looks like: https://gyazo.com/3c0008dd4d5b78c23147b05abcc331e0 Thanks for all who helped. My laptop is an Acer E1-572G-6854, Intel Core i5-4200U 1.6ghz, AMD Radeon R7 M265 w/ 2gb VRAM, 8gb RAM, 1 TB HDD. I recently updated my Laptop's AMD Catalyst Software Suite, and as a result, my laptop will not fully enter sleep mode, normally three LED lights on the front of the laptop turn off, and the laptop makes a clicking noise upon entering sleep mode, it no longer does this. When I do attempt to enter sleep mode, I cannot come out of it at all, and I'm forced to do a manual reboot Computer Type: Laptop - HP ProBook 470 G2 GPU: Intel HD Graphics 4400 / AMD R5 M255 CPU: Intel® CoreTM i7 4510 @2.00 GHz (4 CPUs), ~2.6GHz RAM: 8192MB RAM DDR3 Operating System amp Version: Windows 10 Pro x64 GPU Drivers: AMD 17.6.2 - AMD Catalyst Software Suite 17.10.3211.1011 Crimson ReLive Chipset Drivers: Intel Haswell-ULT Motherboard: Hewlett-Packard 2249 Background Applications: Skype / Chrome  Description of Original Problem: Im trying to stretch my CS:GO which I recently. 
Hello! ampnbsp; I'm having problems playing faceit. Whenever i play faceit with the anti cheat turned on the game will start just fine. I will play a few rounds and suddenly my PC will completely freeze. The last sound played will be repeated, making a horrific robotic screech. Pressing the caps lock key on my keyboard will reveal that the light on the keyboard doesn't change inclining that the system has frozen completely. I will have to hard power ~~I am trying to reinstall the 15.20 series of drivers and when I get to the configuration menu, it says I have the most up to date drivers with 15.150.1004.0. Was there a silent rollback of the 15.20 drivers? I heard there were serious complaints.~~ Update ~~The AMD website clearly states that 15.20 driver was released with the 15.7 catalyst update: "The AMD Catalyst™ Software Suite, AMD Catalyst™ 15.7 contains the following: AMD Catalyst™ Display Driver version 15.20.1046" I want to update or download the latest audio driver for my computer. I currently have: AMD High Definition Audio Device The AMD website says that I have to download "AMD Catalyst Software Suite". The AMD website then refers me to this page: There is no AMD Catalyst Software Suite in that page/link. Please help me, please! I've been trying to solve this blue screen issue for two days now. My whole weekend has been spent sitting in front of the computer. I just bought a Sapphire R9 270X ( graphics card and installed it. EDIT: I'm running Windows 7 64-bit edition. The installer on the driver installation CD it came with only shows this list of compatible cards ( though - it doesn't include the 270X at all. I tried using the CD anyway, and I still ended up (1) not having Windows Aero effects (http://puu.sh/hS2pc/323ae9f8e6. Just installed 0.7 and everything did not go so smooth. After install and reboot there was a constant device disconnect sound the a device connect sound, then a device disconnect sound and a device reconnect sound. The Oculus Configuration Utility also gave me the check HMD is turned off, check the HDMI message. As i can say not impressed. The fix i eventually found was that the 15.20 display driver you need is NOT from the AMD Catalyst 15.7.1, but the 15.20 Display driver "AMD Catalyst™. The thing is drivers from the DELL website no longer work for Windows 10 (They stopped working with Win8). This is the driver that used to work for Windows 7 : AMD ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650/5470/4200/550v Graphics Driver ( After searching the internet this was the best option : http://support.a. 
^Disclaimer: ^Your ^sidebar ^asks ^to ^be ^as ^specific ^as ^possible, ^so. I've run into some problems trying to update my GPU drivers. I know next to nothing about computers, so the problem's probably on my end. I was prompted to install an update (AMD Catalyst Software Suite Omega) and when I did the computer permanently blackscreened. Not usual driver update black screen that lasts a few seconds. I left my computer for two hours and it was still stuck on a black screen.

Now, on this card that's stronger, I can't Hi guys, I've just spent my whole weekend trying to fix my PC, and am just about to give up completely. This is a long story: Basically I had unplugged the monitor overnight, then plugged it back in to find my PC not working. So I did a system restore, and everything seemed to be working OK. I'd been wanting to upgrade to Windows 8.1, and had gotten a key from my brother so I tried that, to find my computer not booting properly. So I ended up reverting back to Windows 7. After reinstalling. I have a new Dell 660 that came with the Intel integrated graphics. I purchased and installed a new Radeon HD 7750 and installed it with success in Windows 8.0. Everything runs A-Okay with my Radeon HD in Windows 8.0. When I upgrade to Windows 8.1, everything seems to go swimmingly at first. After 8.1 is installed I navigate to the desktop and after a couple of minutes my Dell UltraSharp goes into power save mode and then black. No signal. I did this twice (after doing a system refresh). I have an AMD Radeon HD 7750 graphics card, and I wanted to update the drivers. I went to their website, and downloaded the latest version of AMD Catalyst Software Suite. All the drivers installed succesfully, except the Display driver. I looked on Google for a fix, and someone said to unninstall AMD Catalyst Software Suite, and I did. When I tried to install it again, the Display driver failed to install, and now I'm stuck with the 1024x768 resolution. If I try to install the driver manually. Hi, I have a HD6850 and for whatever reason, the graphics tab in my AMD Engine Control Center is not showing up. I just went through a whole process because I couldn't get my AMD Engine Control Center to launch. So, I began the grueling task; first uninstalling the AMD Install Manager through control panel. Then I restarted my computer in safe mode and ran drive sweeper to get rid of everything AMD. I repaired my net 4 and restarted the computer again. I then installed the latest AMD Catalyst. I recently did a fresh install of Windows but I'm confused as to which version of the Suite I should install as the newer ones (and a few of the older ones) don't install CCC. The autodetect never gives me any options to install it as Windows gets the driver automatically. Out of the ones I have tried before my fresh install, 11.7 x64 and 11.11 x64 give me CCC and I've tried a handful of supposedly compatible drivers that don't. I really don't want to install and uninstall a whole bunch Bit of backstory: I made the switch from a GTX 960 to an AMD Rx 580 4gb. To my dismay I find out it doesn't have drivers fro W8.1, forcing me to upgrade to 10 which I didn't really want to. I still upgraded, currently writing from W10, and now I'm trying to make heads and tails of the new suite. For starters, I download the drivers from here: https://www.amd.com/en/support/graphics/radeon-500-series/radeon-rx-500-series/radeon-rx-580 (https://www.amd.com/en/support/graphics/radeon-500-series/r. SPECS: HP Pavilion g4 Windows 10-64 bit 8GB RAM Intel core i3-3110M CPU Intel HD Graphics 4000 AMD Radeon 7600M Series (switchable graphics) One day, I downloaded this old game (HP Half-Blood Prince) and it didn't work; I only got a black screen. I read up a guide and something mentioned tinkering with the Switchable Graphics settings. I booted up AMD Catalyst Control Center (CCC) to force the game's .exe to use the AMD, in case it wasn't already. But it seems my AMD-CCC 
I recently tried playing FTL on my laptop again, but I’m having an issue. I can hear the title screen music, but I can’t see anything; it’s just a black screen. Does anyone have any idea what the issue may be? Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks Subset! For anyone who else who may be searching, the issue for me was that my graphics card wasn't properly updated. The integrated updater wasn't finding the most recent software. I was directed to install the Catalyst Software Suite (https://s. first i know this is an old card but im stuck with it until gpu prices drop a bit more or i see a really good sale. But my question is looking on the support page (https://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/legacy?product=legacy3ampos=Windows+10+-+64) im not 100amp#37; sure what software i should be using. should i use the Catalyst Software Suite or the Radeon Software Crimson Edition.

I just ran across my vrms output from 2012. It's really cool to see that my system now runs better and is now more capable all while using less non-free software. Sometimes I don't really think of the improvements day to day, but looking back it's nice to see that little improvements over time can make a big difference. In fact, vrms didn't even pick up all my non-free usage back then so I was using quite a bit more. The only non-free stuff I have installed now is to get to some old archives. </p>
