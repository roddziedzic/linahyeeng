                            <p>So i got a key for this game (and i've always wanted to play it) but sadly, everytime i launch it, it says: Failed to initialize Direct3D. Make sure you have at least DirectX 9.0c installed, have drivers for your graphics card and have not disabled 3D acceleration in display settings. InitializeEngineGraphics failed My DirectX is version 11, my 3d acceleration is enabled (i saw this via typing dxdiag in the windows key+R menu :p ) I tried everything i could: Updated all drivers and i tried. Pls help much pls? This is kinda new to me i updated the graphic driver http://imgur.com/a/0fL98. I play Rust on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, Nvidia gtx 960 driver version 418.43). I just updated to the latest update (Oil Rig, about 10 minutes ago). When I start the game I get the graphics quality + resolution menu from Unity but after pressing OK the game just quits. Here is the contents of the log (from `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Rust/output_log.txt`) Found path: /home/user/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Rust/rust Mono path 0 = '/home/user/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Rust/rust_Da. 
Everything points to a graphics driver issue but after removing and reinstalling four different versions i'm out of ideas. I've removed the game completely too and reinstalled it (16.4 runs fine ) but when i install b233 it stops working. amp#x200B; Initialize engine version: 2018.2.0f2 (787658998520) Forcing GfxDevice: Direct3D 11 GfxDevice: creating device client; threaded=1 Crash!!! SymInit: Symbol-SearchPath: '.;F:\SteamGames\_F\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die;F:\SteamGames\_F\. Just a few days ago, I was done building my computer, all the games ran fine, but after a few Windows updates, things started getting weird, most games run, but Unity games doesn’t work at all, when running the game, I encountered this error message: “Failed to initialize Direct3D, Make sure you have at least DirectX 9.0c installed, have drivers for your graphics card and have not disabled 3D acceleration in display settings. InitializeEngineGraphics failed” So I started debugging this issue. Hi , i just turned on my gaming laptop after 9 months and started to download games, after doing a fresh wipe before i stopped for nine months. The thing was that when i tried launching games they told me that there was an error, after finding for quite sometime, i found that my direct 3d acceleration was not available and needs to be enabled.The thing is i do not know how to enable it, and i require assistance to this problem. My geforce driver has been updated to the latest version I just bought a gaming laptop it's an Acer Predator Helios 300 it has a GTX 1060 with 6 gb, 256 SSD 16 gb ddr4 ram but for some reason I can't run cuphead, when I open up steam and try to play it gives me this error message, Failed to initialize Direct3D. Make sure you have at least DirectX 9.0c installed, have drivers for your graphics card and have not disabled 3D acceleration in display settings. InitializeEngineGraphics failed Does anyone know what I'm supposed to do? I checked and I belie. A recent Steam update broke my Twilight Struggle (https://store.steampowered.com/app/406290/Twilight_Struggle) installation. Failed to initialize graphics. Make sure you have DirectX 11 installed, have up to date drivers for your graphics card and have not disabled 3D acceleration in display settings. InitializeEngineGraphics failed Here is the output from ``~/.steam/error.log``: GameAction AppID 406290, ActionID 4 : LaunchApp changed task to ProcessingInstallScript. I installed this game last night. At first it had me choose the graphics settings and I chose medium. Cue me getting a black screen with the music playing in the background. I tried to relaunch it and now it doesn't even let me try to see how I want to run it(I would like to try the low graphics setting) and it just gives me this text box saying "Failed to initialize Direct3D. Make sure you have at least DirectX 9.0c installed, have drivers for your graphics card and have not disabled 3D acceler. When I start the executable directly (`MTGA.exe`), everything works, even have normal sound, no weird crashes aside from the expected ones (`GetThreadContext Failed!` while downloading files, thank god for resuming downloads), but I run into just one hiccup: `Your version is outdated, please run MtgaLauncher.exe to update`. Has anyone been able to find out how to get the launcher to actually start? Be that with Lutris, simple Wine prefix, PoL or just plain Windows? When I launch it on Linux. 
Hi everyone! I'm having some trouble. Practically every game gives me the "Failed to initialize player. Details: Failed to initialize Direct3D. InitializeEngineGraphics failed". I'm not the most computer savvy person but I've spent a great deal of time troubleshooting. - Did a complete system restoration. Twice. - Re-downloaded Nvidia driver routines - Re-installed the latest version of DirectX (changed the version value in registry beforehand so it would re-install completely) Hello, I have a problem that sprung out recently. So I downloaded a game called Ironsight and I believe while downloading it, I installed Directx9 with the game (there was a check mark and I did not uncheck it). So I played the game for a day, after that the game wont open, I would get constant crashes. So I uninstalled it and deleted every file that came with it. For example, when I open up Battlerite, I get this message: gt Failed to initialize Direct3D. Make sure you have at least Direc. Failed to initialize Direct3D. Make sure you have at least DirectX 9.0c installed, have drivers for your graphics card and have not disabled 3D acceleration in display settings. InitializeEngineGraphics failed Is what it says when I try to run it. I just got my new laptop so idk if it has to do with that. My laptop is the HP spectre x360 with the radeon RX vega M 16 ram. I was able to run the game when I first installed it but since then it gives me that error. Thank. EDIT: My computer randomly informed me there was a windows update about 4 and a half hours after I made this post. I ran the windows update, and it has now solved both my problems. Hello, I am trying to launch various games on my computer. One example I will pick is "Clustertruck" through the Twitch launcher. The game will attempt to load, and then I am greeted with an error message with the heading " Failed to initialize player ", with the details section reading " Failed Failed to initialize Direct3D.

Anyone encountered this issue before. I have suddenly gotten an error whenever i try to start the game up via steam, anyone got the same problem/knows a solution?
