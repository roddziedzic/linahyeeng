I'm wondering if learning chunks would allow me to phrase what I want to say in a more natural way. My co-worker wrote a research paper on "Chunks" and using them to study.

Hi everyone! I am an advanced English learner but have difficulty speaking English fluently. I hope to find a book which contains several topics with 2-3 passages under the topic. Thus I can listen to and read after the audio to memorize the collocations and lexical chunks automatically. I found the series English in use is great, but I cannot find the audio with that.

Hey everyone, I want to translate a list of words, somewhat between 500 and 1000 non-repeating words from Portuguese to english.

I would like to propose an line or method of investigation and see what people think about it.
